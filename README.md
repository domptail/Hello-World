# hello-world
Hello!

I am an environmental engineer with 8 years of international development experience. Please see my LinkedIn profile.

I am interested in data analytics, particularly for 'development' and 'data for good' projects.

This GitHub repository includes ongoing personal projects which help me get hands-on experience and complement my online classes.

An engineer by training, I have a solid mathematical background. I also have good communication skills thanks to years of experience as an international consultant. 

My current focus is thus developing programming skills:
- Database querying: SQL 
- Data visualization: Excel, Power BI, Tableau
- Programming languages: Python, R

Please feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn profile!
