# Hello World!
Hello!

I am an environmental engineer with 8 years of international development experience. Please see my LinkedIn profile for more details on my background and experience.

I am interested in data analytics / data science, particularly for 'development' and 'data for good' projects.

This GitHub repository includes ongoing personal projects. The goal is to help me get hands-on experience and complement online classes.

I have a solid mathematical background due to my engineering training, and good communication skills thanks to years of international consulting. 

My current focus is improving my programming skills, including:
- Database querying: SQL 
- Data visualization: Excel, Power BI, Tableau
- Programming languages: Python, R

Please feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn profile!
