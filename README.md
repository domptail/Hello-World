# hello-world
Hello!

I am an environmental engineer with 8 years of international development experience. Please see my LinkedIn profile.

I am interested in data analytics, particularly for 'development' and 'data for good' projects.

While still new to the field, I decided to work on personal projects to get hands-on experience and complement my online classes.

An engineer by training, I have a solid mathematical background. I also have good communication skills thanks to my years of experience as an international consultant. 

I am thus focusing on developing my programming skills:
- Database querying: SQL (EdX / Microsoft class)
- Data visualization: Excel, Power BI, Tableau (EdX and Coursera classes)
- Programming languages: Python, R
